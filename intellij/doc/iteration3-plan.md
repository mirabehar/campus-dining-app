Iteration 1:
We will start with **Access Menu**.

Iteration 2: We will add parts to **Access Menu** (such as using the dining API) and work on **Make Profile** and **Set Preferences**.

Iteration 3: We will finish implementing the API for **Access Menu** (which has turned out to be very challenging).
            We will also work on data persistence (database for profiles, and bundles to save states of fragments).
            If we are able to we will also address the **Rate Item** use case.
